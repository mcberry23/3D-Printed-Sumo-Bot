# 3D-Printed-Sumo-Bot

An initial development of a cheap 3D printed sumo robot to serve as a base design for a maker training course.

## Topics to be Taught Through Project

* Robotics and Interdiscplinary Engineering Design
* SolidWorks 3D Design
* 3D Printing
* Arduino Robotics Integration
* Electrical Prototyping and Soldering
* C Programming
* Sensor Management

## General Requirements of Project

* Total cost per bot: <= $50
* Shall be capable of being built in one semester with <= 4 hours spent per week
* Shall be capable of staying within a white ring on a black surface unopposed
* Shall be capable of searching for opponent bot

## Technical Requirements of Project

* 3D printed robot base with light color for high light reflectivity for IR
* Front wedge/plate
* 4 x AA Batteries w/ battery holder
* 2 x 3D printed robot wheels/sled
* 2 x servo mounted wheels
* 2 continuous rotating servo motors
* 1 cheap Arduino based microcontroller (Trinket, Teensy, Nano, Metro, Mini, clone etc.)
* 1 forward facing distance sensor (ultrasonic or IR)
* 2 downward facing line detection sensors
* 1 pushbutton for start button (provided by SPARC inventory)
